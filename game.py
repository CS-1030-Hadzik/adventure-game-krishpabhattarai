TODOs
 
 # TODO: Create a class called Player to represent the player in the game
 
 # TODO: Inside the Player class, define an __init__ method that:
 #       - Takes a name parameter
 #       - Initializes these attributes:
 #         - self.name (string)
 #         - self.inventory (empty list)
 #         - self.health (set to 100)
 #         - self.has_map (set to False)
 #         - self.has_lantern (set to False)
 
 # TODO: Replace the global variable player_name with a Player object
 #       Example: player = Player("Scott")
 
 # TODO: Update your welcome_player() function to return a Player object
 #       Instead of returning just a name, create and return the Player
 
 # TODO: Update add_to_inventory() so it:
 #       - Accepts a Player object as a parameter
 #       - Appends the item to player.inventory
 #       - Prints a message confirming the item was picked up
 
 # TODO: In path 1, after picking up the lantern:
 #       - Set player.has_lantern = True
 
 # TODO: In path 2, after picking up the map:
 #       - Set player.has_map = True
 
 # TODO: (Optional Stretch) Add a check before certain choices
 #       - Example: If player.has_lantern is False, prevent entering a cave
 #       - Print a message like “It’s too dark to continue without a lantern.”
 
 # TODO: Update all print statements that used player_name to use player.name
 
 # TODO: Commit and push your code with a message like:
 #       REF player class added and game state flags implemented
